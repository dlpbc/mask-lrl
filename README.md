# Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Modulating Masks
Code for paper [Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Modulating Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11110).
Implementation of modulatory mask combined with PPO. The repository contains MASK RI/LC/BLC implementations. Please see EWC branch for implemenation of PPO and Online EWC.

**This branch contains the implementation and code to run PPO combined with MASK BLC (Balanced Linear Combination).**

The code was developed on top of the existing [DeepRL](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL) repository, extending PPO RL agents to lifelong learning setting.

Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.12.0 were used for experiments in the paper.

For Mask RI/LC/BLC experiment and other baselines in the Procgen benchmark, please visit this [repository](https://github.com/dlpbc/mask-lrl-procgen).

## Evaluation environments
- [CT-graph](https://github.com/soltoggio/CT-graph)
- [Minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-minigrid)
- [Continual World](https://github.com/awarelab/continual_world) (see note below)

## Requirements
- See requirements.txt file
- See [CT-graph](https://github.com/soltoggio/CT-graph) requirements.
- See [Minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-minigrid) requirements.
- See [Continual World](https://github.com/dlpbc/continual_world) requirements and how to install. Note, MuJoCo (now freely available) is required to run Continual World

## Usage
Example commands below using [Minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-minigrid) environment.
To run agents in the minigrid (MG10) curriculum defined in the paper, use the command below:

```
# balanced linear combination of mask (MASK BLC) agent.
python train_minigrid.py ll_supermask --new_task_mask linear_comb --seed 86
```

Note: 
- the full list of commands to run experiments in the paper can be found in the `paper_experiments.txt` file.
- the commands to run the random initialization (MASK RI) and the linear combination (MASK BLC) agents can be found in the `master` git branch.
- sample commands and the full list of commands for `ewc` experiments in the paper can be found in the `exp_ewc` git branch. 
- sample commands and the full list of commands for setting up the single task expert (STE) experiments can be found in the `exp_ste` git branch.

## Note on Continual World
The Continual World benchmark was built on top of the [Meta-World](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld) benchmark, which comprise of a number of simulated robotics tasks. The originally released Continual World employed the use of version 1 (v1) Meta-World environments. However, the Meta-World v1 environments contained some issues in the reward function (discussed [here](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld/issues/226) and [here](https://github.com/awarelab/continual_world/issues/2)) which was fixed in the updated v2 environments. Therefore, the experiments in the paper employed the use of the v2 environment for each task in the Continual World. The modification can be downloaded from the forked repository [here](https://github.com/dlpbc/continual_world).
