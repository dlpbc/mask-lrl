# Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Modulating Masks
Code for paper [Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Modulating Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11110).
Implementation of modulatory mask combined with PPO. The repository contains MASK RI/LC/BLC implementations. Please see EWC branch for implemenation of PPO and Online EWC.

**This branch contains the code to run MASK RI_D (discrete-value modulatory mask) for Continual World experiment.**

The code was developed on top of the existing [DeepRL](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL) repository, extending PPO RL agents to lifelong learning setting.

Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.12.0 were used for experiments in the paper.

For Mask RI/LC/BLC experiment and other baselines in the Procgen benchmark, please visit this [repository](https://github.com/dlpbc/mask-lrl-procgen).

## Evaluation environments
- [CT-graph](https://github.com/soltoggio/CT-graph)
- [Minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-minigrid)
- [Continual World](https://github.com/awarelab/continual_world) (see note below)

## Requirements
- See requirements.txt file
- See [CT-graph](https://github.com/soltoggio/CT-graph) requirements.
- See [Minigrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-minigrid) requirements.
- See [Continual World](https://github.com/dlpbc/continual_world) requirements and how to install. Note, MuJoCo (now freely available) is required to run Continual World

## Usage
The branch is specific for running experiments for discrete/binary masks for MASK RI agents in continualworld's CW10 curriculum. See sample command below:
```
# MASK RI_D agent in CW10
python train_continualworld.py ll_supermask --new_task_mask random --seed 436
```

Note: 
- the full list of commands to run experiments in the paper can be found in the `paper_experiments.txt` file.
- in the `master` branch, the above command will execute as a MASK RI\_C (random initialisation of mask agent that uses continuous value masks) experiment.

## Note on Continual World
The Continual World benchmark was built on top of the [Meta-World](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld) benchmark, which comprise of a number of simulated robotics tasks. The originally released Continual World employed the use of version 1 (v1) Meta-World environments. However, the Meta-World v1 environments contained some issues in the reward function (discussed [here](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld/issues/226) and [here](https://github.com/awarelab/continual_world/issues/2)) which was fixed in the updated v2 environments. Therefore, the experiments in the paper employed the use of the v2 environment for each task in the Continual World. The modification can be downloaded from the forked repository [here](https://github.com/dlpbc/continual_world).
